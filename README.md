# E-Wallet, paypal-like
paypal like app.
You can create users and transfer funds from one user to another using their username. The main goal of this app is to mimic the functionality of a money-transfer wallet.


 okay so here's how to set this shi up
# Frontend:
### Vite@react.js
```
  cd Frontend # ofc, even a kid knows why
  npm i # get all your dependencies in, make sure to have internet
  npm run dev #pretty basic
```

### Note: the `dev` script exposes the frontend on the local network as well, to run it just on localhost, remove `--host` from dev script options

# Backend:
### requires you to have docker-compose@3.8
```
  cd Backend
  docker-compose pull
  docker-compose up
```
### the logs would help you with the rest
### Any suggestion for improvements are appreciated
